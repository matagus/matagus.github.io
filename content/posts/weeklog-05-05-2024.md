This week I finished reading [Thoughtful Machine Learning With Python](https://chipublib.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S126C1872069) and made a good progress with [Deep Learning With Python](https://chipublib.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S126C1994077). I keep adding more libraries, frameworks and utilities to my [LLMs & AI](https://github.com/stars/matagus/lists/llms-ai) list in Github. Just trying to understand a little bit more every week about this part of the universe.

Next, I'm going to read [La posibilidad de una isla](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/106913.La_posibilidad_de_una_isla) by Michel Houellebecq. In Spanish, because I still enjoy **fiction** in Spanish more than I do in English. I already read *Las part√≠culas elementales* two years ago and I really enjoyed it. Also, getting back to read some fiction, trying to get fiction / real world readings balance.

Two **podcasts** I keep listening as soon as a new episode gets out: [Co-recursive](https://corecursive.com/) and [Django Chat](https://djangochat.com/). I wish there were more podcasts like Co-recursive, with real histories about developers and software development.

I keep learning **Rust**. Snail learning. This week I think I made a good progress, I can feel my brain being now able to *think in Rust*. Patience and practice paying off I guess. Also, it's worth mentioning that [Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) and [Perplexity.ai](https://www.perplexity.ai/) had been of great help. Seeing what possible implementations Copilot suggests helps me see possible implementations. I don't always take them as they are, but they help. I've been experimenting with [cursive](https://github.com/gyscos/cursive) but feeling that I should be using [ratatui](https://ratatui.rs/). Cursive wins at simplicity I guess. I'll be trying to write a command line tool for [ClickUp](https://clickup.com/) (we use it at work). I might end up porting [this one I already made with Python](https://github.com/matagus/keyup), I still don't know.

I also started playing with [Textual](https://www.textualize.io/), I'd like to do a terminal-based UI, maybe for ClickUp, maybe for Jira given that I already did some experiments with [a web client for it](https://github.com/matagus/jirahub). We'll see. So far I'm really happy learning to use textual.

Yesterday, I played *futbol* (soccer for US people) with some friends at the [Maradona Field](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Maradona+Field/@41.9351533,-87.6359938,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x880fd3ee28709c6f:0x752ebd46ba99a005!8m2!3d41.9351533!4d-87.6334189!16s%2Fg%2F11pwykh_ct?entry=ttu). It seems we gonna be doing that every Saturday. And I also managed to do a god amount of running and biking, more than what I had been able to do ever before.
