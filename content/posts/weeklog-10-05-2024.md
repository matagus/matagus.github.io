This week I added [Zen Mode](https://github.com/folke/zen-mode.nvim) and [Twilight](https://github.com/folke/twilight.nvim) to my NeoVim config + a new colorscheme: [Material]:

I also configured [Telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim) to allow me to switch between Material colorscheme styles:

I keep doing progress learning **Rust**. Copilot is helping me to explore how to build TUIs (Terminal UIs) using [cursive](https://github.com/gyscos/cursive) or [ratatui](https://ratatui.rs/). This same learning process took me to start experimenting with [Textual](https://textual.textualize.io/) in **Python** to improve one of my Open source Projects: [KeyUp](https://github.com/matagus/keyup), a client for accessing Clickup Lists and Tasks. I think my next week coding efforts will be focused here.

I guess I should read [In the Beginning was the Command Line](https://hackneys.com/docs/in-the-beginning-was-the-command-line.pdf) sooner than later, right?

I keep reading a lot about deep learning. I should be finishing  [Deep Learning With Python](https://chipublib.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S126C1994077) ina few days now. [This post](https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2024/04/using-embeddings-in-production-with-postgres-django-for-niche-ad-targeting/) from the guys working at [Ethical Ads](https://www.ethicalads.io/) about how to use embeddings + Postgres + Django really opened my eyes. I also enjoyed other related articles about [embeddings](https://simonwillison.net/2023/Oct/23/embeddings/), [how a dev got into deep learning](https://www.vikas.sh/post/how-i-got-into-deep-learning), [how to beat propietary LLMs](https://www.aidancooper.co.uk/how-to-beat-proprietary-llms/) and [Simon Willson coming up with the word "Slop"](https://simonwillison.net/2024/May/8/slop/) *as the term for unwanted AI generated content*.

And the [Geranius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geranium) seeds I planted a week ago are now seeing the sunlight:
