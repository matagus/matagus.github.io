A lot of reading this week. I finished [The Cathedral and the Bazaar](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/) by Eric S. Raymond. And I'm almost done with [The Mythical Man-Month](https://archive.org/details/MythicalManMonth) by Frederick P. Brooks Jr.  I should have read them 20 years ago. A quote from the latter still shines in my mind:

> *I have long enjoyed asking candidate programmers, "Where is next November?" If the question is too cryptic, then, "Tell me about your mental model of the calendar." **The really good programmers have strong spatial senses**; they usually have geometric models of time; and they quite often understand the first question without elaboration.*

Btw I'm reading them on paper. The [Chicago Public Library](https://www.chipublib.org/) is awesome, I have the opportunity to get most of the books I want to read on paper.

Next week I'll start reading [Deep Learning With Python](https://chipublib.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S126C1994077). I also started really understanding, I mean technically, how LLMs work, and [how we can build apps using them](https://lethain.com/mental-model-for-how-to-use-llms-in-products/). I'm doing kind of a curse following [these notebooks by Langchain people](RAG From Scratch). This graph is awesome, it really made me understand a lot of thing about RAGs and LLMs:

On the Open Source side of the life, I added some more nice articles to my [awesome-django-articles list](https://github.com/matagus/awesome-django-articles) about how to create Single-File Django Projects: [one by Eric Matthes](https://www.mostlypython.com/django-from-first-principles/) and the [other one by Paolo Melchiorre](https://www.paulox.net/2023/10/26/udjango_micro_django/). Both good reads.

Work. It was a busy week. Intense. In a good sense. We finished our first integration with Salesforce (the 3rd one I do as a developer). I've started to notice how coding for more than a year now in such a fast and big project have improved my knowledge and skill about Django and DRF.

I started following [John Cutler](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnpcutler/) and [Tom Dekan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomdekan/) at LinkedIn. The former posted this quote from [The Lean Mindset: Ask the Right Questions](https://www.amazon.com/Lean-Mindset-Ask-Right-Questions/dp/0321896904):

> *What's next is to stop thinking about software development as a delivery process and to start thinking of it as a problem-solving pro-cess, a creative process. Time and again we run into software delivery organizations-IT departments operating as cost centers and software firms working under contract-whose job is to turn someone else's requirements into delivered software. Agile practices have helped these organizations handle requirements in smaller batches, reduce work-in-progress, and speed up software delivery. But unfortunately, agile practices do not address the underlying problem: **the very idea of a software delivery organization is flawed**.*

This resonated with me, with how the company I work for approaches almost *every feature we need to build*.

Music is always present in my life of course. I watched [Stagger Lee official video by Nick Cave](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbe5RERDh4k) for the 899 times now. I think Nick Cave is the kind of artist *you need to watch, not just listen to*.

Also, a few new artists I listened this week: [Annelies Monere](https://open.spotify.com/artist/77o0VKxSaoTHU2egfNo2UG?si=lZwiU_ayQVmXekxFSRejQQ), [Colle](https://open.spotify.com/artist/1Ntmc8ccjS54sdx3ZVqqPI?si=GqU1oBd_Qyy7Mb7xVnBFfg) and [Eartheater](https://open.spotify.com/artist/18ca9d5EU5R1AhVKPR1cm0?si=EYJfgGRjTqqKF9PHbr0cfg).

Finally one pending task remains in my TO-DO list: go and get my Illinois ID!
